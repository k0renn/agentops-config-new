        - Never commit secrets; use environment variables.
  governance:
    default_base_policy: org-defaults
    principles:
      - 'Repository-first governance: existing code and repoScan-defined rules are authoritative.'
      - Missing logic is prohibited; implement only what is evidenced in the repository.
      - Delegation implies non-ownership (e.g., Clerk for auth, Stripe for payments, Convex for persistence/runtime).
      - Changes must stay within allowed paths for each service; scope creep is forbidden.
    source_of_truth: DATA.repoScan
    source_of_truth_rule: DATA.repoScan is the only primary source of truth; existing code is intentional; missing logic is prohibited; delegation implies non-ownership.
