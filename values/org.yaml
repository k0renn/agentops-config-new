        default_base_policy: org-defaults
        principles:
            - 'Repository-first governance: existing code and repoScan-defined rules are authoritative.'
            - Missing logic is prohibited; implement only what is evidenced in the repository.
            - Delegation implies non-ownership (e.g., Clerk for auth, Stripe for payments, Convex for persistence/runtime).
            - Changes must stay within allowed paths for each service; scope creep is forbidden.
